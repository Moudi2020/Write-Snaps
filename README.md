# Write-Snaps
This is my first ios-swift app. I have decided to open source the project to give the opportunity for others to either fork and (build/ fix) or just to be used as learning project for them.

The Idea of the project is similar to snapchat feature where you can either take a pic from your gallery or camera and then write or draw on top of it. You can then send or save the pic on your phone.
