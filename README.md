# Write-Snaps
This is my first ios-swift app. I have decide to open source the project to give the opportunity for others to either fork and (build/ fix) or just to be used as learning project for them.

The Idea of the project is similar to snapchat feaute where you will be able to either take a pic from your gallery or phone and then write or draw on top it. You can then send or save the pic on your phone.
